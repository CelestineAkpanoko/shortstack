Thank you! Superhelpful!

Next, I would like to update the code and implement other functionalities.

I want to change the student data and form. 
First, it should have username and expect an email. 
And the email should be the student school email, 
and this should be reflected in the form. Remove the school name. 
I am using prisma. When the teacher clicks add student, 
it should send an email of the login to the student's email. 
The email should greet the student by their name 
and provide their password and instructions on how to find 
and login into the class. When the student clicks on the guest 
page that they are a student, then a login form display entailing 
their school email and password, after logging in, 
it takes the student to the student dashboard, 
different from teacher's. When the student clicks on 
the classes page, it populates the classes they have already 
joined by their class code and with a add button to 
add more or the first if none has been added. 
When the student clicks to add a new class, 
it pops up a dialog for the student to enter the class code, 
when the student hit enter, it displays the class that 
belongs to that code and a join button on the class, 
and if the code is wrong it says error. 
When the student clicks join, it automatically takes 
the student to the student view class page.
